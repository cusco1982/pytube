# Pytube Script for Mac

## Introduction

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)
- pip (Python package installer)

To check if Python is installed on your Mac, open Terminal and type:
```sh

If Python is not installed, macOS will prompt you to download Command Line Tools. After installation, retry the command to check Python version.

Alternatively, create a folder named "pytube". Inside, create a file named "main.py", open it with a text editor, paste the code, and save.

You'll be prompted to input the YouTube URL. Press Enter, and a "downloads" folder will be created in your "pytube" folder containing the downloaded videos.
