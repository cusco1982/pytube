# PyTube Script for Mac

## Introduction
This PyTube script allows Mac users to easily download YouTube videos directly to their computers. Simple to use and efficient, it's perfect for saving your favorite videos offline.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, you need to have Python and pip installed on your Mac. You can check if you already have them installed by opening the Terminal and typing:

- For Python: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- For pip: `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`

If these are not installed, your Mac will prompt you to download Command Line Tools. Follow the instructions to install them. Afterward, check again to see if Python and pip are successfully installed.

## Installation
Once Python and pip are set up, you can proceed to install the PyTube script. Here's how to do it without cloning from a repository:

1. **Create a PyTube Folder:** Make a new folder named `pytube` on your Mac.
2. **Create the Script File:** Inside the `pytube` folder, create a file named `main.py`. Open it with any text editor, paste the provided PyTube script code, and save the file.
3. **Run the Script:** Open Terminal, navigate to the `pytube` folder using `cd path/to/pytube`, and run the script by typing `python3 main.py`.

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to input the YouTube URL you wish to download. After hitting enter, a `downloads` folder will be created inside the `pytube` folder, where all downloaded YouTube videos will be saved.

## Features
- Download videos directly from YouTube with a simple URL input.
- Automatically creates a `downloads` folder for your videos.
- Easy to install and use on any Mac with Python.
